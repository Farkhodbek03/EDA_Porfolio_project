Provide Data-Driven Recommendations: Suggest actionable steps for reducing inventory and reorganizing storage.

Tools and Technologies Used
MySQL Workbench: For querying and analyzing the database.

SQL: For writing queries to extract insights from the data.

GitHub: For version control and sharing the project.


Key Insights
Underutilized Warehouses: Some warehouses (e.g., warehouseCode G) have low inventory levels and can be consolidated.

Overstocked Products: Products like productCode Y and productCode K have high inventory but low sales.

Slow-Moving Products: Products like productCode A and productCode B have no sales and should be discontinued.

High-Selling Products: Products like productCode I and productCode J are top sellers and should be prioritized for inventory management.

Recommendations
Discontinue Slow-Moving Products: Free up storage space by discontinuing products with no sales.

Reorganize Inventory: Consolidate inventory from underutilized warehouses into others.

Optimize Stock Levels: Reduce inventory for overstocked products and increase inventory for high-selling products.

Close Underutilized Warehouses: Close warehouses with low inventory levels (e.g., warehouseCode N).
